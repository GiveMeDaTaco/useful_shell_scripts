In the realm of data, so vast and wide,
Where tables and rows diligently abide,
On Halloween night, the queries took flight,
In search of treats, oh what a sight!

SELECT * FROM houses WHERE candy = 'lots';
SQL whispered softly, connecting the dots.
INNER JOIN giggles ON laughter = true,
Bringing joy and sweets for me and you.

SAS chimed in with a PROC SQL cheer,
"Let’s analyze candy, from far and near!
SUM, COUNT, AVG, let’s find the mean,
On this spooky night, let’s set the scene."

DATA costumes; SET fun_disguises;
RUN; with laughter, as the sun rises.
WHERE mask = 'spooky' AND cape = 'long',
We'll GROUP BY treats, oh nothing could go wrong.

LEFT JOIN witches ON brooms = 'fast',
RIGHT JOIN ghosts, a spectral cast.
FULL JOIN pumpkins ON porches aglow,
In the database of Halloween, the data flow.

INDEXED BY the twinkle in each eye,
PARTITIONED BY the stars in the sky.
The datasets danced, free and alive,
On Halloween night, they'd surely thrive.

So here's to SQL, SAS, and all the data fun,
On Halloween night, when the queries run.
May your joins be smooth and your datasets clean,
Happy Halloween to all, on this data scene!
